            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a former healthcare office manager who has transitioned to software development in the past year.  I was a healthcare office manager for nine years before I decided to make the move to a new career.  I have always had a strong passion for all things computers, and loved to problem solve so I felt this would be a great fit for me moving forward.</p>
